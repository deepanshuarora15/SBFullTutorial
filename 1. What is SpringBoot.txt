1. Spring Boot helps in rapid application development (RAD).
2. It helps in easy dependency management with its starter template GUI.
3. SB projects have an embedded server within them. So instead of creating a WAR file and then go around the problem of deploying them,
   we can generate a simple JAR file and then go onto host it on the environment of our choice - hassle free. Hence the project
   is by default - production ready.
4. SB is the default option if you wanna build microservices in Java.
