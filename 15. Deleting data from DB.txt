1. For deleting data, we would be using 'DELETE' method from the Postman client.
2. DepartmentController.java

 @DeleteMapping(path = "/deleteDepartment/{departmentId}")
    public String deleteDepartmentById(@PathVariable Long departmentId){
        departmentService.deleteDepartmentById(departmentId);
        return "Department " + departmentId.toString() + " deleted successfully";
    }


3. DepartmentService.java

void deleteDepartmentById(Long departmentId);


4. DepartmentServiceImpl.java

@Override
    public void deleteDepartmentById(Long departmentId) {
        departmentRepository.deleteById(departmentId);
    }
