1. We can also find out the Department by non conventional fields like DeaprtmentName which is not a primary key.
   Such methods are not available directly in jpaRepository and hence can not be called directly.
2. Workaround is that we need to define the prototype in the Repso interface. After that we can use the method in the service class
   using the repo object.
3. We can also implement methods for ignorecase search by name.
4. Controller

 @GetMapping("/getDepartmentByName/{departmentName}")
    public Department getDepartmentByName(@PathVariable String departmentName){
        return departmentService.getDepartmentByName(departmentName);
    }

    @GetMapping("/getDepartmentByNameIgnoreCase/{departmentName}")
    public Department getDepartmentByNameIgnoreCase(@PathVariable String departmentName){
        return departmentService.getDepartmentByNameIgnoreCase(departmentName);
    }

5. DepartmentService

    Department getDepartmentByNameIgnoreCase(String departmentName);


6. DepartmentServiceImpl.java

 @Override
    public Department getDepartmentByName(String departmentName) {
        return departmentRepository.findDepartmentByDepartmentName(departmentName);
    }

    @Override
    public Department getDepartmentByNameIgnoreCase(String departmentName) {
        return departmentRepository.findByDepartmentNameIgnoreCase(departmentName);
    }

7. DepartmentRepository.java

Department findDepartmentByDepartmentName(String departmentName);
Department findByDepartmentNameIgnoreCase(String departmentName);
