1. Whenever an exception occurs, we need to send an appropriate msg to the front end team so they handle the UI accordingly.
2. We need to be careful of the HTTP codes that we are sending. Eg: if the client asks for data for department 5 and the department itself
   does not exist, then the default response is HTTP 500 : Internal Server Error.
3. But this should not be the response that we should be sending ideally. the reason being: there is no internal server error.
   The server is working fine. We need to handle the exception and tell the user that ok, data not found for this department id.
