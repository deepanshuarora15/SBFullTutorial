1. Architecture is such that the 
   controller -> service -> Repsoitory layer -> DB

2. Service layer os the layer that contains the business logic.
3. Controller layer is just for routing i.e.t gets the request and responds to them. But behind the scenes logic is captured in
   the service layer only.
4. Service layer beneath uses the Data Access Layer i.e DAO layer or repository layer. This layer is the one that is supposed
   to talk to your database. All database operations would be contained in this layer only.
