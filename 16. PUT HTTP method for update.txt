1. PUT http method is used for update.
2. Inside the method, we take in both the PathVariable and RequestBody.
3. PathVariable tells us the id of the department that needs to be updated and RequestBody will contian the Department class object.
4. Then in this example, we have just found out the department from the db, stored that in the object and updated its fields,
   as per the fields from the RequestBody object.

5. DepartmentServiceImpl.java

@Override
    public Department updateDepartment(Long departmentId, Department department) {
        Department departmentfromDb = departmentRepository.findById(departmentId).get();
        if(Objects.nonNull(department.getDepartmentName())
            && department.getDepartmentName().length()!=0
        ){
            departmentfromDb.setDepartmentName(department.getDepartmentName());
        }
        if(Objects.nonNull(department.getDepartmentAddress())
                && department.getDepartmentAddress().length()!=0
        ){
            departmentfromDb.setDepartmentAddress(department.getDepartmentAddress());
        }
        if(Objects.nonNull(department.getDepartmentCode())
                && department.getDepartmentCode().length()!=0
        ){
            departmentfromDb.setDepartmentCode(department.getDepartmentCode());
        }
        return departmentRepository.save(departmentfromDb);
    }

6. DepartmentController.java

@PutMapping("/updateDepartment/{departmentId}")
    public Department updateDepartment(@PathVariable Long departmentId, @RequestBody Department department){
        return departmentService.updateDepartment(departmentId, department);
    }

7. Doubt: in the  end, when we save the object to the DB, why don't we get an error for primary key integrity violation?
