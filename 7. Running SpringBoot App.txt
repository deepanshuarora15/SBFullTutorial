package com.dailycodebuffer.springBoot.tutorial.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping(path="/helloworld")
    public String HelloWorld(){
        return "Welcome to my tutorial bitches";
    }
}


2. If you do not want to run via GUI in your IDE, open the terminal inside the IDE instead and run the command:
   mvn spring-boot:run

3. Every controller must have the annotation @RestController at the top of the class. Similarly every method inside the controller,
   must have one of the following 4 annotations. Note: it is not compulsory for the methods to have these annotations, but if they
   do not have them. they would be dead functions - as there would exist no way to call them.
4. The 4 annotations are:
   a. DeleteMapping
   b. GetMapping
   c. PostMapping
   d. PutMapping
